# Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Demand-Estimation

This repository contains a modified version of the code published on https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/aer.p20151021. The code is modified in the following aspects:

1. Use of newer state of the art R packages for the machine learning methods for faster computation
2. additional more complex discrete choice modells (mixed and nested logit)
3. additional Script for out of sample period forecasts insteed of random sample forecasts
